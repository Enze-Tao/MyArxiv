However, the self-attention\nmechanism of ViT captures the global context from the outset, overlooking the\ninherent relationships between neighboring pixels in images or videos.\nTransformers mainly focus on global information while ignoring the fine-grained\nlocal details. Consequently, ViT lacks inductive bias during image or video\ndataset training. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with their\nreliance on local filters, possess an inherent inductive bias, making them more\nefficient and quicker to converge than ViT with less data. In this paper, we\npresent a lightweight Depth-Wise Convolution module as a shortcut in ViT\nmodels, bypassing entire Transformer blocks to ensure the models capture both\nlocal and global information with minimal overhead. Additionally, we introduce\ntwo architecture variants, allowing the Depth-Wise Convolution modules to be\napplied to multiple Transformer blocks for parameter savings, and incorporating\nindependent parallel Depth-Wise Convolution modules with different kernels to\nenhance the acquisition of local information.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel Therblig-based Backbone Framework (TBBF) to enhance robot\ntask understanding and transferability. This framework uses therbligs (basic\naction elements) as the backbone to decompose high-level robot tasks into\nelemental robot configurations, which are then integrated with current\nfoundation models to improve task understanding. The approach consists of two\nstages: offline training and online testing. During the offline training stage,\nwe developed the Meta-RGate SynerFusion (MGSF) network for accurate therblig\nsegmentation across various tasks. In the online testing stage, after a\none-shot demonstration of a new task is collected, our MGSF network extracts\nhigh-level knowledge, which is then encoded into the image using Action\nRegistration (ActionREG). Additionally, the Large Language Model\n(LLM)-Alignment Policy for Visual Correction (LAP-VC) is employed to ensure\nprecise action execution, facilitating trajectory transfer in novel robot\nscenarios.

UHD images inherently possess\nhigh computational complexity, leading existing UHD LLIE methods to employ\nhigh-magnification downsampling to reduce computational costs, which in turn\nresults in information loss. The wavelet transform not only allows downsampling\nwithout loss of information, but also separates the image content from the\nnoise. It enables state space models (SSMs) to avoid being affected by noise\nwhen modeling long sequences, thus making full use of the long-sequence\nmodeling capability of SSMs. On this basis, we propose Wave-Mamba, a novel\napproach based on two pivotal insights derived from the wavelet domain: 1) most\nof the content information of an image exists in the low-frequency component,\nless in the high-frequency component. 2) The high-frequency component exerts a\nminimal influence on the outcomes of low-light enhancement.

In general, GS-based methods\ncomprise two key stages: initialization and rendering optimization. To achieve\ninitialization, existing works directly apply random sphere initialization or\n3D diffusion models, e.g., Point-E, to derive the initial shapes. However, such\nstrategies suffer from two critical yet challenging problems: 1) the final\nshapes are still similar to the initial ones even after training; 2) shapes can\nbe produced only from simple texts, e.g., \"a dog\", not for lexically richer\ntexts, e.g., \"a dog is sitting on the top of the airplane\". To address these\nproblems, this paper proposes a novel general framework to boost the 3D GS\nInitialization for text-to-3D generation upon the lexical richness. Our key\nidea is to aggregate 3D Gaussians into spatially uniform voxels to represent\ncomplex shapes while enabling the spatial interaction among the 3D Gaussians\nand semantic interaction between Gaussians and texts.

However, annotating massive numbers of pixel-level images is\nlabor-intensive and costly, especially for multi-temporal images, which require\npixel-wise comparisons by human experts. Considering the excellent performance\nof visual language models (VLMs) for zero-shot, open-vocabulary, etc. with\nprompt-based reasoning, it is promising to utilize VLMs to make better CD under\nlimited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a VLM guidance-based\nsemi-supervised CD method, namely SemiCD-VL. The insight of SemiCD-VL is to\nsynthesize free change labels using VLMs to provide additional supervision\nsignals for unlabeled data. However, almost all current VLMs are designed for\nsingle-temporal images and cannot be directly applied to bi- or multi-temporal\nimages. Motivated by this, we first propose a VLM-based mixed change event\ngeneration (CEG) strategy to yield pseudo labels for unlabeled CD data. Since\nthe additional supervised signals provided by these VLM-driven pseudo labels\nmay conflict with the pseudo labels from the consistency regularization\nparadigm (e.g. FixMatch), we propose the dual projection head for de-entangling\ndifferent signal sources. Further, we explicitly decouple the bi-temporal\nimages semantic representation through two auxiliary segmentation decoders,\nwhich are also guided by VLM. Finally, to make the model more adequately\ncapture change representations, we introduce metric-aware supervision by\nfeature-level contrastive loss in auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments\nshow the advantage of SemiCD-VL. For instance, SemiCD-VL improves the FixMatch\nbaseline by +5.3 IoU on WHU-CD and by +2.4 IoU on LEVIR-CD with 5% labels. In\naddition, our CEG strategy, in an un-supervised manner, can achieve performance\nfar superior to state-of-the-art un-supervised CD methods.\n","authors":["Kaiyu Li","Xiangyong Cao","Yupeng Deng","Junmin Liu","Deyu Meng","Zhi Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04788v3.pdf","comment":"13 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01089v1","updated":"2024-08-02T08:08:56Z","published":"2024-08-02T08:08:56Z","title":"Prototypical Partial Optimal Transport for Universal Domain Adaptation","summary":"  Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled\nsource domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring the same label\nsets of both domains.

We discuss the pros and cons of each mediator,\nproviding insights as to when particular kinds of mediators and search methods\nare most appropriate depending on the goals of a given study. We argue that\nthis framing yields a more cohesive narrative of the field, as well as\nactionable insights for future work. Specifically, we recommend a focus on\ndiscovering new mediators with better trade-offs between human-interpretability\nand compute-efficiency, and which can uncover more sophisticated abstractions\nfrom neural networks than the primarily linear mediators employed in current\nwork. We also argue for more standardized evaluations that enable principled\ncomparisons across mediator types, such that we can better understand when\nparticular causal units are better suited to particular use cases.\n","authors":["Aaron Mueller","Jannik Brinkmann","Millicent Li","Samuel Marks","Koyena Pal","Nikhil Prakash","Can Rager","Aruna Sankaranarayanan","Arnab Sen Sharma","Jiuding Sun","Eric Todd","David Bau","Yonatan Belinkov"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01416v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01415v1","updated":"2024-08-02T17:43:34Z","published":"2024-08-02T17:43:34Z","title":"Conditional LoRA Parameter Generation","summary":"  Generative models have achieved remarkable success in image, video, and text\ndomains.

It is argued here that machine\nself-confidence - a form of meta-reasoning based on self-assessments of an\nagent's knowledge about the state of the world and itself, as well as its\nability to reason about and execute tasks - leads to many eminently computable\nand useful competency indicators for such agents.

In FaMSeC, self confidence\nindicators are derived from hierarchical `problem-solving statistics' embedded\nwithin broad classes of probabilistic decision-making algorithms such as Markov\ndecision processes. The problem-solving statistics are obtained by evaluating\nand grading probabilistic exceedance margins with respect to given competency\nstandards, which are specified for each of the various decision-making\ncompetency factors by the informee (e.g. a non-expert user or an expert system\ndesigner).

To address these challenges, we propose StitchFusion, a\nstraightforward yet effective modal fusion framework that integrates\nlarge-scale pre-trained models directly as encoders and feature fusers. This\napproach facilitates comprehensive multi-modal and multi-scale feature fusion,\naccommodating any visual modal inputs. Specifically, Our framework achieves\nmodal integration during encoding by sharing multi-modal visual information. To\nenhance information exchange across modalities, we introduce a\nmulti-directional adapter module (MultiAdapter) to enable cross-modal\ninformation transfer during encoding. By leveraging MultiAdapter to propagate\nmulti-scale information across pre-trained encoders during the encoding\nprocess, StitchFusion achieves multi-modal visual information integration\nduring encoding. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on four multi-modal segmentation datasets\nwith minimal additional parameters.

Due to the coupling between\nrouting and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route\nconstruction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to\nexact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated\ndesign but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach\nbased on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction\nand purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution\nfrom a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a\nbipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product\nrelations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite\ngraph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant benefit\nof our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the\npolicy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing\nplan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, leveraging DRL,\nwe can train the policy network to optimize the global solution objective.\nFurthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be\ntrained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across\ninstances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances\nthat are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP\ninstances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can\nsignificantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the\noptimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially\non large-sized instances.\n","authors":["Haofeng Yuan","Rongping Zhu","Wanlu Yang","Shiji Song","Keyou You","Yuli Zhang","C.

One is based on the Shtarkov solution (often called the\nnormalized maximum likelihood) in the normal experts setting and the other is\nbased on Dirichlet process priors. These comparisons are for two cases. The\nfirst is one-pass meaning that the updating of the predictors is done using the\nfact that the CMS is a sketch.

However, the scarcity of labeled data remains a\nmajor challenge in this field, limiting the widespread use of EEG-based emotion\nrecognition. In this paper, a semi-supervised Dual-stream Self-Attentive\nAdversarial Graph Contrastive learning framework (termed as DS-AGC) is proposed\nto tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in cross-subject EEG-based\nemotion recognition.

The structural stream develops a\ngraph contrastive learning method to extract effective graph-based feature\nrepresentation from multiple EEG channels in a semi-supervised manner.

Mesh editing methods are typically framed as\noptimization problems combining user-specified vertex constraints with a\nregularizer that determines the position of the rest of the vertices. The\nchoice of the regularizer is key to the realism and authenticity of the final\nresult. Physics and geometry-based regularizers are not aware of the global\ncontext and semantics of the object, and the more recent deep learning priors\nare limited to a specific class of 3D object deformations. Our main\ncontribution is a vertex-based mesh editing method called DragD3D based on (1)\na novel optimization formulation that decouples the rotation and stretch\ncomponents of the deformation and combines a 3D geometric regularizer with (2)\nthe recently introduced DDS loss which scores the faithfulness of the rendered\n2D image to one from a diffusion model. Thus, our deformation method achieves\nglobally realistic shape deformation which is not restricted to any class of\nobjects. Our new formulation optimizes directly the transformation of the\nneural Jacobian field explicitly separating the rotational and stretching\ncomponents. The objective function of the optimization combines the approximate\ngradients of DDS and the gradients from the geometric loss to satisfy the\nvertex constraints. Additional user control over desired global shape\ndeformation is made possible by allowing explicit per-triangle deformation\ncontrol as well as explicit separation of rotational and stretching components\nof the deformation. We show that our deformations can be controlled to yield\nrealistic shape deformations that are aware of the global context of the\nobjects, and provide better results than just using geometric regularizers.\n","authors":["Tianhao Xie","Eugene Belilovsky","Sudhir Mudur","Tiberiu Popa"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04561v2.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 8 figures, project page:\n  https://tianhaoxie.github.io/project/DragD3D/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09916v2","updated":"2024-08-02T13:59:12Z","published":"2024-04-15T16:43:13Z","title":"Comprehensive Library of Variational LSE Solvers","summary":"  Linear systems of equations can be found in various mathematical domains, as\nwell as in the field of machine learning.

Prior works primarily center on\nevaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook\nthe prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as\nimage cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of\nMLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI,\nthe first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within\nPerturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios,\ncontaining 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is\naccompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination\ntypes, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations\nwith a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative\nand generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as\nGPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant\nhallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios.\nFurthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle\ndifferent types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically\nfor perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope\nthat our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs\nwhen dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address\nthis issue.

To this end, in this paper, we develop a\nnovel diffusion model to accurately predict the progression of IPF by\ngenerating patient's follow-up CT scan from the initial CT scan. Specifically,\nfrom the clinical prior knowledge, we tailor improvements to the traditional\ndiffusion model and propose a Clinically-Informed Residual Diffusion model,\ncalled CIResDiff. The key innovations of CIResDiff include 1) performing the\ntarget region pre-registration to align the lung regions of two CT scans at\ndifferent time points for reducing the generation difficulty, 2) adopting the\nresidual diffusion instead of traditional diffusion to enable the model focus\nmore on differences (i.e., lesions) between the two CT scans rather than the\nlargely identical anatomical content, and 3) designing the clinically-informed\nprocess based on CLIP technology to integrate lung function information which\nis highly relevant to diagnosis into the reverse process for assisting\ngeneration.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred for CIL. In this work, we revisit\nCIL with PTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model\nupdating and generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal\nthat frozen PTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL.\nSurprisingly, a simple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the\nclassifiers of PTM to prototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without\ntraining on the downstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between\npre-trained and downstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with\nadaptivity via model adaptation. We propose AdaPt and mERge (APER), which\naggregates the embeddings of PTM and adapted models for classifier\nconstruction. APER is a general framework that can be orthogonally combined\nwith any parameter-efficient tuning method, which holds the advantages of PTM's\ngeneralizability and adapted model's adaptivity. 3) Additionally, considering\nprevious ImageNet-based benchmarks are unsuitable in the era of PTM due to data\noverlapping, we propose four new benchmarks for assessment, namely ImageNet-A,\nObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

Though sarcasm detection\nin text has been extensively studied, there are situations in which textual\ninput alone might be insufficient to perceive sarcasm.

This study presents a novel framework for\nmultimodal sarcasm detection that can process input triplets. Two components of\nthese triplets comprise the input text and its associated image, as provided in\nthe datasets.

An often overlooked issue is the cost of\nthe labeling process, which is typically high due to the need for a significant\ninvestment in time and money associated with human experts. Existing\nsemi-supervised learning methods often focus on operating in the feature space\ncreated by the fusion of available modalities, neglecting the potential for\ncross-utilizing complementary information available in each modality.

Next, information about the instances'\nclass membership in each modality is exchanged based on the Euclidean distance\nto ensure more accurate labeling.

Most of DML methods for CBIR rely on a\nhigh number of annotated images to accurately learn model parameters of deep\nneural networks (DNNs). However, gathering such data is time-consuming and\ncostly. To address this, we propose an annotation cost-efficient active\nlearning (ANNEAL) method tailored to DML-driven CBIR in RS. ANNEAL aims to\ncreate a small but informative training set made up of similar and dissimilar\nimage pairs to be utilized for accurately learning a metric space. The\ninformativeness of image pairs is evaluated by combining uncertainty and\ndiversity criteria. To assess the uncertainty of image pairs, we introduce two\nalgorithms: 1) metric-guided uncertainty estimation (MGUE); and 2) binary\nclassifier guided uncertainty estimation (BCGUE). MGUE algorithm automatically\nestimates a threshold value that acts as a boundary between similar and\ndissimilar image pairs based on the distances in the metric space. The closer\nthe similarity between image pairs is to the estimated threshold value the\nhigher their uncertainty. BCGUE algorithm estimates the uncertainty of the\nimage pairs based on the confidence of the classifier in assigning correct\nsimilarity labels. The diversity criterion is assessed through a\nclustering-based strategy. ANNEAL combines either MGUE or BCGUE algorithm with\nthe clustering-based strategy to select the most informative image pairs, which\nare then labelled by expert annotators as similar or dissimilar. This way of\nannotating images significantly reduces the annotation cost compared to\nannotating images with land-use land-cover class labels.

Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the\nmodality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread\nattention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs\nrely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent\ncapabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread\nattention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for\nMLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate\npaths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality\ndata contribute to better performance of MLLMs; on the other hand, MLLMs can\nfacilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and\nMLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stages of MLLMs specific\ndata-centric approaches can be employed to enhance certain MLLM capabilities,\nand 2) how MLLMs, utilizing those capabilities, can contribute to multi-modal\ndata in specific roles. To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM\ncommunity, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the\ndata-model co-development perspective.

Accurately identifying the products\nbeing sold by salespeople, i.e., livestreaming product retrieval (LPR), poses a\nfundamental and daunting challenge. The LPR task encompasses three primary\ndilemmas in real-world scenarios: 1) the recognition of intended products from\ndistractor products present in the background; 2) the video-image heterogeneity\nthat the appearance of products showcased in live streams often deviates\nsubstantially from standardized product images in stores; 3) there are numerous\nconfusing products with subtle visual nuances in the shop. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Graphing Multi-modal Network (SGMN).\nFirst, we employ a text-guided attention mechanism that leverages the spoken\ncontent of salespeople to guide the model to focus toward intended products,\nemphasizing their salience over cluttered background products.

Such models remain nonetheless\nvery expensive to train and to perform inference with, which strongly reduce\ntheir applicability to videos, and yields unreasonable computational loads.

Nevertheless, this task remains\ndifficult because of the complex video scenes, such as video defocus and\nself-occlusion. Recent methods strive to integrate multi-frame visual features\ngenerated by a backbone network for pose estimation. However, they often ignore\nthe useful joint information encoded in the initial heatmap, which is a\nby-product of the backbone generation. Comparatively, methods that attempt to\nrefine the initial heatmap fail to consider any spatio-temporal motion\nfeatures. As a result, the performance of existing methods for pose estimation\nfalls short due to the lack of ability to leverage both local joint (heatmap)\ninformation and global motion (feature) dynamics.\n  To address this problem, we propose a novel joint-motion mutual learning\nframework for pose estimation, which effectively concentrates on both local\njoint dependency and global pixel-level motion dynamics. Specifically, we\nintroduce a context-aware joint learner that adaptively leverages initial\nheatmaps and motion flow to retrieve robust local joint feature. Given that\nlocal joint feature and global motion flow are complementary, we further\npropose a progressive joint-motion mutual learning that synergistically\nexchanges information and interactively learns between joint feature and motion\nflow to improve the capability of the model.

The\nrich representation of VLP models holds significant promise for enhancing UDA\ntasks. To address this, we propose a novel method called Cross-Modal Knowledge\nDistillation (CMKD), leveraging VLP models as teacher models to guide the\nlearning process in the target domain, resulting in state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred for CIL. In this work, we revisit\nCIL with PTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model\nupdating and generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal\nthat frozen PTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL.\nSurprisingly, a simple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the\nclassifiers of PTM to prototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without\ntraining on the downstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between\npre-trained and downstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with\nadaptivity via model adaptation. We propose AdaPt and mERge (APER), which\naggregates the embeddings of PTM and adapted models for classifier\nconstruction. APER is a general framework that can be orthogonally combined\nwith any parameter-efficient tuning method, which holds the advantages of PTM's\ngeneralizability and adapted model's adaptivity. 3) Additionally, considering\nprevious ImageNet-based benchmarks are unsuitable in the era of PTM due to data\noverlapping, we propose four new benchmarks for assessment, namely ImageNet-A,\nObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

An often overlooked issue is the cost of\nthe labeling process, which is typically high due to the need for a significant\ninvestment in time and money associated with human experts. Existing\nsemi-supervised learning methods often focus on operating in the feature space\ncreated by the fusion of available modalities, neglecting the potential for\ncross-utilizing complementary information available in each modality. To\naddress this problem, we propose Cross-Modality Clustering-based Self-Labeling\n(CMCSL). Based on a small set of pre-labeled data, CMCSL groups instances\nbelonging to each modality in the deep feature space and then propagates known\nlabels within the resulting clusters. Next, information about the instances'\nclass membership in each modality is exchanged based on the Euclidean distance\nto ensure more accurate labeling. Experimental evaluation conducted on 20\ndatasets derived from the MM-IMDb dataset indicates that cross-propagation of\nlabels between modalities -- especially when the number of pre-labeled\ninstances is small -- can allow for more reliable labeling and thus increase\nthe classification performance in each modality.\n","authors":["Paweł Zyblewski","Leandro L.

The literature presents numerous approaches to\nboost performance while ensuring robustness for neurorobots using sEMG, often\nresulting in models requiring high processing power, large datasets, and less\nscalable solutions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing the\ndecoding of muscle synchronization rather than individual muscle activation. We\nstudy coherence-based functional muscle networks as the core of our perception\nmodel, proposing that functional synchronization between muscles and the\ngraph-based network of muscle connectivity encode contextual information about\nintended hand gestures. This can be decoded using shallow machine learning\napproaches without the need for deep temporal networks.

Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated to\nuncovering the theories underpinning ICL. One popular hypothesis explains ICL\nby task selection. LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and\ngeneralize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form\nof meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training\ntime and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues that\nLLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during\npre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these three\nhypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of\nexperiments derived from common text classification tasks. We invalidate the\nfirst two hypotheses with counterexamples and provide evidence in support of\nthe last hypothesis.

Consistent reasoning,\nwhich lies at the core of human intelligence, is the ability to handle tasks\nthat are equivalent, yet described by different sentences ('Tell me the time!'\nand 'What is the time?'). The CRP asserts that consistent reasoning implies\nfallibility -- in particular, human-like intelligence in AI necessarily comes\nwith human-like fallibility. Specifically, it states that there are problems,\ne.g. in basic arithmetic, where any AI that always answers and strives to mimic\nhuman intelligence by reasoning consistently will hallucinate (produce wrong,\nyet plausible answers) infinitely often. The paradox is that there exists a\nnon-consistently reasoning AI (which therefore cannot be on the level of human\nintelligence) that will be correct on the same set of problems. The CRP also\nshows that detecting these hallucinations, even in a probabilistic sense, is\nstrictly harder than solving the original problems, and that there are problems\nthat an AI may answer correctly, but it cannot provide a correct logical\nexplanation for how it arrived at the answer. Therefore, the CRP implies that\nany trustworthy AI (i.e., an AI that never answers incorrectly) that also\nreasons consistently must be able to say 'I don't know'.

Often the goal isn't just\npoint prediction but determining uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty,\nespecially the aleatoric uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of market\ndrivers, helps investors understand varying risk levels. Recently, quantile\nregression forests (QRF) have emerged as a promising solution: Unlike most\nbasic quantile regression methods that need separate models for each quantile,\nquantile regression forests estimate the entire conditional distribution of the\ntarget variable with a single model, while retaining all the salient features\nof a typical random forest. We introduce a novel approach to compute quantile\nregressions from random forests that leverages the proximity (i.e., distance\nmetric) learned by the model and infers the conditional distribution of the\ntarget variable. We evaluate the proposed methodology using publicly available\ndatasets and then apply it towards the problem of forecasting the average daily\nvolume of corporate bonds. We show that using quantile regression using Random\nForest proximities demonstrates superior performance in approximating\nconditional target distributions and prediction intervals to the original\nversion of QRF.

However, the DNN parameter\nupdate in CL-based autonomous systems is extremely resource-hungry. The\nexisting DNN accelerators cannot be directly employed in CL because they only\nsupport the execution of the forward propagation. Only a few prior\narchitectures execute the backpropagation and weight update, but they lack the\ncontrol and management for CL. Towards this, we design a hardware architecture,\nTinyCL, to perform CL on resource-constrained autonomous systems. It consists\nof a processing unit that executes both forward and backward propagation, and a\ncontrol unit that manages memory-based CL workload. To minimize the memory\naccesses, the sliding window of the convolutional layer moves in a snake-like\nfashion. Moreover, the Multiply-and-Accumulate units can be reconfigured at\nruntime to execute different operations.

Decreasing embedding\ndimensions significantly deteriorates model performance. While several recent\nefforts utilize knowledge distillation or non-Euclidean representation learning\nto augment the effectiveness of low-dimensional KGE, they either necessitate a\npre-trained high-dimensional teacher model or involve complex non-Euclidean\noperations, thereby incurring considerable additional computational costs. To\naddress this, this work proposes Confidence-aware Self-Knowledge Distillation\n(CSD) that learns from the model itself to enhance KGE in a low-dimensional\nspace.

Moreover, a specific semantic module is developed to\nfilter reliable knowledge by estimating the confidence of previously learned\nembeddings.

In this work, we relax these\nassumptions and propose a novel algorithm for task-agnostic online\nmeta-learning in non-stationary environments. More specifically, we first\npropose two simple but effective detection mechanisms of task switches and\ndistribution shift based on empirical observations, which serve as a key\nbuilding block for more elegant online model updates in our algorithm: the task\nswitch detection mechanism allows reusing of the best model available for the\ncurrent task at hand, and the distribution shift detection mechanism\ndifferentiates the meta model update in order to preserve the knowledge for\nin-distribution tasks and quickly learn the new knowledge for\nout-of-distribution tasks. In particular, our online meta model updates are\nbased only on the current data, which eliminates the need of storing previous\ndata as required in most existing methods.

While the\nrelationship between sample size and CI width is well understood, the effect of\nexperiment duration on CI width remains less clear. This paper provides an\nanalytical formula for the width of a CI based on a ratio treatment effect\nestimator as a function of both sample size (N) and duration (T). The formula\nis derived from a mixed effects model with two variance components. One\ncomponent, referred to as the temporal variance, persists over time for\nexperiments where the same users are kept in the same experiment arm across\ndifferent days. The remaining error variance component, by contrast, decays to\nzero as T gets large. The formula we derive introduces a key parameter that we\ncall the user-specific temporal correlation (UTC), which quantifies the\nrelative sizes of the two variance components and can be estimated from\nhistorical experiments. Higher UTC indicates a slower decay in CI width over\ntime. On the other hand, when the UTC is 0 -- as for experiments where users\nshuffle in and out of the experiment across days -- the CI width decays at the\nstandard parametric 1/T rate. We also study how access to pre-period data for\nthe users in the experiment affects the CI width decay.

We construct such a dataset from a single fractal with\nperturbations. With this, we contribute three main findings. (i) We show that\npre-training is effective even with minimal synthetic images, with performance\non par with large-scale pre-training datasets like ImageNet-1k for full\nfine-tuning. (ii) We investigate the single parameter with which we construct\nartificial categories for our dataset.

The\nsignificant differences in perspectives create a substantial domain gap between\nthe views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In\nthis paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for\nsynthesizing satellite images from street-view images, leveraging diffusion\nmodels and Bird's Eye View (BEV) paradigm. First, we design a Curved-BEV method\nto transform street-view images to the satellite view, reformulating the\nchallenging cross-domain image synthesis task into a conditional generation\nproblem. Curved-BEV also includes a \"Multi-to-One\" mapping strategy for\ncombining multiple street-view images within the same satellite coverage area,\neffectively solving the occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, we design\na BEV-controlled diffusion model to generate satellite images consistent with\nthe street-view content, which also incorporates a light manipulation module to\noptimize the lighting condition of the synthesized image using a reference\nsatellite. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on both suburban (CVUSA & CVACT) and urban\n(VIGOR-Chicago) cross-view datasets, with an average SSIM increase of 14.5% and\na FID reduction of 29.6%, achieving realistic and content-consistent satellite\nimage generation.

Building on\nthis, we introduce a memory-efficient spatial-spectral UMamba (SSUMamba) for\nHSI denoising, with the spatial-spectral continuous scan (SSCS) Mamba being the\ncore component. SSCS Mamba alternates the row, column, and band in six\ndifferent orders to generate the sequence and uses the bidirectional SSM to\nexploit long-range spatial-spectral dependencies. In each order, the images are\nrearranged between adjacent scans to ensure spatial-spectral continuity.\nAdditionally, 3D convolutions are embedded into the SSCS Mamba to enhance local\nspatial-spectral modeling.

The inherently explainable\nattribution method aims to enhance the understanding of model behavior by\nidentifying the important regions in images that significantly contribute to\npredictions. It is achieved by cooperatively training a selector (generating an\nattribution map to identify important features) and a predictor (making\npredictions using the identified features). Despite many advancements, existing\nmethods suffer from the incompleteness problem, where discriminative features\nare masked out, and the interlocking problem, where the non-optimized selector\ninitially selects noise, causing the predictor to fit on this noise and\nperpetuate the cycle. To address these problems, we introduce a new objective\nthat discourages the presence of discriminative features in the masked-out\nregions thus enhancing the comprehensiveness of feature selection. A\npre-trained detector is introduced to detect discriminative features in the\nmasked-out region. If the selector selects noise instead of discriminative\nfeatures, the detector can observe and break the interlocking situation by\npenalizing the selector.

Post-training\nquantization (PTQ), a promising method for model compression, still faces\naccuracy degradation challenges with ViTs. There are two reasons for this: the\nexisting quantization paradigm does not fit the power-law distribution of\npost-Softmax activations well, and accuracy inevitably decreases after\nreparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations.

Event cameras possess remarkable attributes such as high dynamic range,\nlow latency, and resilience against motion blur, which enables them to address\nchallenging high dynamic range scenes or high-speed motion. These features make\nevent cameras an ideal complement over standard cameras for object pose\nestimation. In this work, we propose a line-based robust pose estimation and\ntracking method for planar or non-planar objects using an event camera.\nFirstly, we extract object lines directly from events, then provide an initial\npose using a globally-optimal Branch-and-Bound approach, where 2D-3D line\ncorrespondences are not known in advance. Subsequently, we utilize event-line\nmatching to establish correspondences between 2D events and 3D models.\nFurthermore, object poses are refined and continuously tracked by minimizing\nevent-line distances. Events are assigned different weights based on these\ndistances, employing robust estimation algorithms. To evaluate the precision of\nthe proposed methods in object pose estimation and tracking, we have devised\nand established an event-based moving object dataset.

Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple\ncross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale\nmulti-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips\nwith visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.\nTrailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames,\nand background music.

(2) the corresponding background music is\ncustom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these\ninsights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various\nmodality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos.

The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled\nvideos as training data. The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a\nsignificant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in\nthe feature space. We refer to this property as the \"Anomaly Cluster\" issue.\nThe condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish\nbetween normal and abnormal data in the training set. Consequently, training\nconventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often\nleads to sub-optimal results. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new\nmethod called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out\nthe Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset. Following the k-nearest\nneighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection\ncapability. Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a\nsignificant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed\ncleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem.

The essential of the\nEVC task is to effectively perceive subtle and ambiguous visual emotional cues\nduring the caption generation, which is neglected by the traditional video\ncaptioning. Existing emotional video captioning methods perceive global visual\nemotional cues at first, and then combine them with the video features to guide\nthe emotional caption generation, which neglects two characteristics of the EVC\ntask. Firstly, their methods neglect the dynamic subtle changes in the\nintrinsic emotions of the video, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of\ncommon scenes with diverse and changeable emotions. Secondly, as their methods\nincorporate emotional cues into each step, the guidance role of emotion is\noveremphasized, which makes factual content more or less ignored during\ngeneration. To this end, we propose a dual-path collaborative generation\nnetwork, which dynamically perceives visual emotional cues evolutions while\ngenerating emotional captions by collaborative learning. Specifically, in the\ndynamic emotion perception path, we propose a dynamic emotion evolution module,\nwhich first aggregates visual features and historical caption features to\nsummarize the global visual emotional cues, and then dynamically selects\nemotional cues required to be re-composed at each stage.

Current multi-modal\nbenchmarks primarily focus on facts or specific topic-related knowledge\ncontained within individual images.

Most prior systems typically only consider a subset of\nthese elements, leaving a gap from realistic humanoid agent. In this work, we\npropose a real-time, duplex, interactive end-to-end network capable of modeling\nrealistic agent behaviors, including speech, full-body movements for talking,\nresponding, idling, and manipulation. This system is a multimodal model\nintegrating audio and visual inputs, extended from a pre-trained large language\nmodel (LLM). We collect approximately 200,000 hours of audio, around 130,000\nhours of video data, and about 20,000 alignment samples to build the model.

When\ncapturing multiple inputs, image signal processing (ISP) in modern cameras will\nindependently enhance them, including exposure adjustment, color correction,\nlocal tone mapping, etc. While these processings greatly improve image quality,\nthey often break the multi-view consistency assumption, leading to \"floaters\"\nin the reconstructed radiance fields. To address this concern without\ncompromising visual aesthetics, we aim to first disentangle the enhancement by\nISP at the NeRF training stage and re-apply user-desired enhancements to the\nreconstructed radiance fields at the finishing stage. Furthermore, to make the\nre-applied enhancements consistent between novel views, we need to perform\nimaging signal processing in 3D space (i.e. \"3D ISP\"). For this goal, we adopt\nthe bilateral grid, a locally-affine model, as a generalized representation of\nISP processing. Specifically, we optimize per-view 3D bilateral grids with\nradiance fields to approximate the effects of camera pipelines for each input\nview. To achieve user-adjustable 3D finishing, we propose to learn a low-rank\n4D bilateral grid from a given single view edit, lifting photo enhancements to\nthe whole 3D scene.

This observation\nmotivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most\neffectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this\ncompute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute\nscaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a\nFLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model\nattains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to\noutperform a 14x larger model.\n","authors":["Charlie Snell","Jaehoon Lee","Kelvin Xu","Aviral Kumar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03314v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03720v3","updated":"2024-08-06T17:26:55Z","published":"2023-10-05T17:40:09Z","title":"SteP: Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions","summary":"  Performing tasks on the web presents fundamental challenges to large language\nmodels (LLMs), including combinatorially large open-world tasks and variations\nacross web interfaces. Simply specifying a large prompt to handle all possible\nbehaviors and states is extremely complex, and results in behavior leaks\nbetween unrelated behaviors. Decomposition to distinct policies can address\nthis challenge, but requires carefully handing off control between policies. We\npropose Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions (SteP), an approach to dynamically\ncompose policies to solve a diverse set of web tasks. SteP defines a Markov\nDecision Process where the state is a stack of policies representing the\ncontrol state, i.e., the chain of policy calls. Unlike traditional methods that\nare restricted to static hierarchies, SteP enables dynamic control that adapts\nto the complexity of the task. We evaluate SteP against multiple baselines and\nweb environments including WebArena, MiniWoB++, and a CRM.

Meanwhile, the implicitly learned mapping between historical\nobservations to the prediction targets tend to over-simplify the dynamics of\nreal-world urban flows, leading to suboptimal predictions. Some recent\nspatio-temporal prediction solutions bring remedies with the notion of\nphysics-guided machine learning (PGML), which describes spatio-temporal data\nwith nuanced and principled physics laws, thus enhancing both the prediction\naccuracy and interpretability. However, these spatio-temporal PGML methods are\nbuilt upon a strong assumption that the observed data fully conforms to the\ndifferential equations that define the physical system, which can quickly\nbecome ill-posed in urban flow prediction tasks. The observed urban flow data,\nespecially when sliced into time-dependent snapshots to facilitate predictions,\nis typically incomplete and sparse, and prone to inherent noise incurred in the\ncollection process. As a result, such physical inconsistency between the data\nand PGML model significantly limits the predictive power and robustness of the\nsolution.

Although the improved learning rate\nhas a mild dependence on the Gram matrix, we still need to set it small enough\nin practice due to the unknown eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. More\nimportantly, the convergence rate is tied to the least eigenvalue of the Gram\nmatrix, which can lead to slow convergence. In this work, we provide the\nconvergence analysis of natural gradient descent (NGD) in training two-layer\nPINNs, demonstrating that the learning rate can be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, and at\nthis rate, the convergence rate is independent of the Gram matrix.\n","authors":["Xianliang Xu","Ting Du","Wang Kong","Ye Li","Zhongyi Huang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00573v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01294v2","updated":"2024-08-06T12:24:07Z","published":"2024-08-02T14:31:37Z","title":"Feature Clock: High-Dimensional Effects in Two-Dimensional Plots","summary":"  Humans struggle to perceive and interpret high-dimensional data.

Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to\ndiscover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to\nremember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself,\nwhich reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our\nframework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data\ngeneration, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM\ntasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework\nachieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which\nalso demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic\ndata and privacy risks in LLM scenarios.\n","authors":["Yuxin Wang","Duanyu Feng","Yongfu Dai","Zhengyu Chen","Jimin Huang","Sophia Ananiadou","Qianqian Xie","Hao Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02927v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00799v2","updated":"2024-08-06T03:03:16Z","published":"2024-07-22T02:27:57Z","title":"Deep Uncertainty-Based Explore for Index Construction and Retrieval in\n  Recommendation System","summary":"  In recommendation systems, the relevance and novelty of the final results are\nselected through a cascade system of Matching -> Ranking -> Strategy.

Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in\nthe form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent\ntuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain\nbehaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such\nfeatures can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important\nexample of such images are so-called \\textit{triangle plots}, which visually\nrepresent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device\ncalibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is\n\\textit{good} and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning,\nthey do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the\ncase of \\textit{bad} images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and\nmodel intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent\nstudy introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor\nwavelet transform [1].

By providing a few contextual demonstrations, developers can\nutilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate\ncomplex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets,\nwhich will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents.

These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can\nactivate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters\nspecific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM's\ncontextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize\npoisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts,\nreporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in\na two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable\ncontext-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality\nactivation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program\ndefects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack\nby developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents.

Existing methods\nstruggle to consistently address different types of overfitting, typically\ndesigning strategies that focus separately on either natural or adversarial\npatterns. In this work, we adopt a unified perspective by solely focusing on\nnatural patterns to explore different types of overfitting.

This behaviour\nmanifests as DNNs suddenly becoming high-confidence in predicting certain\ntraining patterns and retaining a persistent memory for them.

Safe CLTR was introduced to mitigate these risks when using inverse\npropensity scoring to correct for position bias. However, the existing safety\nmeasure for CLTR is not applicable to state-of-the-art CLTR methods, cannot\nhandle trust bias, and relies on specific assumptions about user behavior. Our\ncontributions are two-fold. First, we generalize the existing safe CLTR\napproach to make it applicable to state-of-the-art doubly robust CLTR and trust\nbias. Second, we propose a novel approach, proximal ranking policy optimization\n(PRPO), that provides safety in deployment without assumptions about user\nbehavior. PRPO removes incentives for learning ranking behavior that is too\ndissimilar to a safe ranking model. Thereby, PRPO imposes a limit on how much\nlearned models can degrade performance metrics, without relying on any specific\nuser assumptions. Our experiments show that both our novel safe doubly robust\nmethod and PRPO provide higher performance than the existing safe inverse\npropensity scoring approach. However, in unexpected circumstances, the safe\ndoubly robust approach can become unsafe and bring detrimental performance.

However, prior works focus primarily on geometric\nreconstruction and visualization, neglecting the key role of language in\nproviding a semantic interface for navigation and fine-grained understanding.\nIn constrained 3D domains, recent methods have leveraged vision-and-language\nmodels as a strong prior of 2D visual semantics. While these models display an\nexcellent understanding of broad visual semantics, they struggle with\nunconstrained photo collections depicting such tourist landmarks, as they lack\nexpert knowledge of the architectural domain. In this work, we present a\nlocalization system that connects neural representations of scenes depicting\nlarge-scale landmarks with text describing a semantic region within the scene,\nby harnessing the power of SOTA vision-and-language models with adaptations for\nunderstanding landmark scene semantics. To bolster such models with\nfine-grained knowledge, we leverage large-scale Internet data containing images\nof similar landmarks along with weakly-related textual information. Our\napproach is built upon the premise that images physically grounded in space can\nprovide a powerful supervision signal for localizing new concepts, whose\nsemantics may be unlocked from Internet textual metadata with large language\nmodels. We use correspondences between views of scenes to bootstrap spatial\nunderstanding of these semantics, providing guidance for 3D-compatible\nsegmentation that ultimately lifts to a volumetric scene representation.

While current methodologies are\nproficient in identifying and pinpointing lesions, they often lack the\nprecision needed to detect minute biomedical entities (e.g., abnormal cells,\nlung nodules smaller than 3 mm), which are critical in blood and lung\npathology. To address this challenge, we propose CAF-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8\narchitecture, a nimble yet robust method for medical object detection that\nleverages the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\ntransformers. To overcome the limitation of convolutional kernels, which have a\nconstrained capacity to interact with distant information, we introduce an\nattention and convolution fusion module (ACFM). This module enhances the\nmodeling of both global and local features, enabling the capture of long-term\nfeature dependencies and spatial autocorrelation.

However, these methods have\nlimitations in modeling spatial-temporal dependency and addressing\nspatial-temporal redundancy: 1) These methods fail to effectively model\nspatial-temporal dependency, due to the lack of long-range information or joint\nspatial-temporal modeling. 2) These methods utilize dense spatial features\nacross the entire temporal resolution, resulting in significant\nspatial-temporal redundancy. In this paper, we propose the Surgical Transformer\n(Surgformer) to address the issues of spatial-temporal modeling and redundancy\nin an end-to-end manner, which employs divided spatial-temporal attention and\ntakes a limited set of sparse frames as input.

Distinct from conventional temporal attention that primarily\nemphasizes dense long-range similarity, HTA not only captures long-term\ninformation but also considers local latent consistency among informative\nframes. HTA then employs pyramid feature aggregation to effectively utilize\ntemporal information across diverse temporal resolutions, thereby enhancing the\noverall temporal representation.

These advanced models, despite their\nimpressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making\nthem susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and\nbiases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias\nwithin image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including\nlimited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework\nthat can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in\nimage generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of\nindividuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using\ngender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39\nactivities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then\ncompares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the\nsignificant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key\ninsight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to\nneutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social\nbias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter\nto evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion\nand Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully\ntrigger social bias in image generation models.

However, these models are vulnerable to minor adversarial\nperturbations, leading to degraded performance on corrupted datasets. Such\nvulnerabilities are further exploited to craft protective perturbations on\nsensitive images like portraits that prevent unauthorized generation. In\nresponse, diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed to remove\nthese perturbations and retain generation performance. However, existing works\nturn to over-purifying the images, which causes information loss. In this\npaper, we take a closer look at the fine-tuning process of personalized\ndiffusion models through the lens of shortcut learning. And we propose a\nhypothesis explaining the manipulation mechanisms of existing perturbation\nmethods, demonstrating that perturbed images significantly deviate from their\noriginal prompts in the CLIP-based latent space. This misalignment during\nfine-tuning causes models to associate noisy patterns with identifiers,\nresulting in performance degradation. Based on these insights, we introduce a\nsystematic approach to maintain training performance through purification. Our\nmethod first purifies the images to realign them with their original semantic\nmeanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive learning with negative\ntokens to decouple the learning of clean identities from noisy patterns, which\nshows a strong potential capacity against adaptive perturbation.

This paper introduces a novel, skinning-centric approach to drive\nanimatronic robot facial expressions from speech input. At its core, the\nproposed approach employs linear blend skinning (LBS) as a unifying\nrepresentation, guiding innovations in both embodiment design and motion\nsynthesis. LBS informs the actuation topology, facilitates human expression\nretargeting, and enables efficient speech-driven facial motion generation.

Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is\nexpected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is\nchallenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the\ndegree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce\nL4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves\nLiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and\nForeground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is\nthe first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and\n4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 )\nparallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion\n(MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under\nadverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with\nsimulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather\nconditions. It delivers a significant performance increase under different fog\nlevels, improving the 3D mAP by up to 18.17% over the traditional LiDAR-only\napproach.

Based on the bottleneck block of MobileNet, we propose three\ndesign principles that significantly curtail the peak memory usage of a CNN so\nthat it can fit the limited KB memory of the low-end device. First, 'input\nsegmentation' divides an input image into a set of patches, including the\ncentral patch overlapped with the others, reducing the size (and memory\nrequirement) of a large input image. Second, 'patch tunneling' builds\nindependent tunnel-like paths consisting of multiple bottleneck blocks per\npatch, penetrating through the entire model from an input patch to the last\nlayer of the network, maintaining lightweight memory usage throughout the whole\nnetwork.

From a security\nperspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the\npopular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting deep\nmodels while not modifying them, current algorithms typically detect\nadversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition for natural and\nadversarial data. However, these decompositions are either biased towards\nfrequency resolution or spatial resolution, thus failing to capture adversarial\npatterns comprehensively. Also, when the detector relies on few fixed features,\nit is practical for an adversary to fool the model while evading the detector\n(i.e., defense-aware attack). Motivated by such facts, we propose a\ndiscriminative detector relying on a spatial-frequency Krawtchouk\ndecomposition. It expands the above works from two aspects: 1) the introduced\nKrawtchouk basis provides better spatial-frequency discriminability, capturing\nthe differences between natural and adversarial data comprehensively in both\nspatial and frequency distributions, w.r.t. the common trigonometric or wavelet\nbasis; 2) the extensive features formed by the Krawtchouk decomposition allows\nfor adaptive feature selection and secrecy mechanism, significantly increasing\nthe difficulty of the defense-aware attack, w.r.t. the detector with few fixed\nfeatures.

Existing instruction tuning\nmethods, e.g., LLAVA, often connects a pretrained CLIP vision encoder and LLMs\nvia fully fine-tuning LLMs to bridge the modality gap. However, full\nfine-tuning is plagued by catastrophic forgetting, i.e., forgetting previous\nknowledge, and high training costs particularly in the era of increasing tasks\nand modalities. To solve this issue, we introduce MoExtend, an effective\nframework designed to streamline the modality adaptation and extension of\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoExtend seamlessly integrates new experts\ninto pre-trained MoE models, endowing them with novel knowledge without the\nneed to tune pretrained models such as MoE and vision encoders. This approach\nenables rapid adaptation and extension to new modal data or tasks, effectively\naddressing the challenge of accommodating new modalities within LLMs.\nFurthermore, MoExtend avoids tuning pretrained models, thus mitigating the risk\nof catastrophic forgetting.

Although very recent 3DCNN methods\nremedy this gap, they introduce more computational cost due to the selection of\nCNN-based backbones and redundant facial features.\n  To address the above limitations, by considering the timing correlation of\nfacial expressions, we propose a novel framework called FacialPulse, which\nrecognizes depression with high accuracy and speed. By harnessing the\nbidirectional nature and proficiently addressing long-term dependencies, the\nFacial Motion Modeling Module (FMMM) is designed in FacialPulse to fully\ncapture temporal features. Since the proposed FMMM has parallel processing\ncapabilities and has the gate mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing, this\nmodule can also significantly boost the training speed.\n  Besides, to effectively use facial landmarks to replace original images to\ndecrease information redundancy, a Facial Landmark Calibration Module (FLCM) is\ndesigned to eliminate facial landmark errors to further improve recognition\naccuracy. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014 dataset and MMDA dataset (a\ndepression dataset) demonstrate the superiority of FacialPulse on recognition\naccuracy and speed, with the average MAE (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 21%\ncompared to baselines, and the recognition speed increased by 100% compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

It further\nincorporates an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nimportance of task-specific losses based on each task's robustness to pruning.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of AdapMTL through comprehensive experiments\non popular multitask datasets, namely NYU-v2 and Tiny-Taskonomy, with different\narchitectures, showcasing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\npruning methods.\n","authors":["Mingcan Xiang","Steven Jiaxun Tang","Qizheng Yang","Hui Guan","Tongping Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03913v1.pdf","comment":"13 pages, 9 figures, Published at ACM Multimedia (ACM MM) 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03909v1","updated":"2024-08-07T17:13:46Z","published":"2024-08-07T17:13:46Z","title":"LaFA: Latent Feature Attacks on Non-negative Matrix Factorization","summary":"  As Machine Learning (ML) applications rapidly grow, concerns about\nadversarial attacks compromising their reliability have gained significant\nattention.

However, there is a trade-off between model performance and\nfairness, i.e., improving model fairness will decrease model performance.\nExisting approaches have characterized such a trade-off by introducing\nhyperparameters to quantify client's preferences for model fairness and model\nperformance. Nevertheless, these approaches are limited to scenarios where each\nclient has only a single pre-defined preference, and fail to work in practical\nsystems where each client generally have multiple preferences. The key\nchallenge is to design a method that allows the model to adapt to diverse\npreferences of each client in real time.

One way to characterize dependence between components of a\nmultivariate time series data is via Granger Causality (GC). Standard\ntraditional approaches to GC estimation / inference commonly assume linear\ndynamics, however such simplification does not hold in many real-world\napplications where signals are inherently non-linear. In such cases, imposing\nlinear models such as vector autoregressive (VAR) models can lead to\nmis-characterization of true Granger Causal interactions. To overcome this\nlimitation, Tank et al (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine\nLearning, 2022) proposed a solution that uses neural networks with sparse\nregularization penalties.

The\ncore of this approach lies in harnessing the sequential data processing\nstrengths of ViTs along with the superior feature extraction capabilities of\nTCNet, to significantly improve EEG analysis accuracy. In addition, we analyze\nthe importance of how to construct optimal patches for the attention mechanism\nto analyze, balancing both speed and accuracy tradeoffs.

Without\nsacrificing performance, we increase the speed of this model by an order of\nmagnitude (up to 4.32x faster).

The\nmajority of existing TO approaches leverage numerical solvers for design\nevaluations during the optimization and hence have a nested nature and rely on\ndiscretizing the design variables. Contrary to these approaches, herein we\ndevelop a new class of TO methods based on the framework of Gaussian processes\n(GPs) whose mean functions are parameterized via deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we place GP priors on all design and state variables to represent\nthem via parameterized continuous functions. These GPs share a deep neural\nnetwork as their mean function but have as many independent kernels as there\nare state and design variables. We estimate all the parameters of our model in\na single for loop that optimizes a penalized version of the performance metric\nwhere the penalty terms correspond to the state equations and design\nconstraints. Attractive features of our approach include $(1)$ having a\nbuilt-in continuation nature since the performance metric is optimized at the\nsame time that the state equations are solved, and $(2)$ being\ndiscretization-invariant and accommodating complex domains and topologies. To\ntest our method against conventional TO approaches implemented in commercial\nsoftware, we evaluate it on four problems involving the minimization of\ndissipated power in Stokes flow.

To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm\ncalled EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa).

The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings\nof pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities\nbetween the two branches.
